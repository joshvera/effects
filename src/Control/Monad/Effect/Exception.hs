Description : An Exception effect and handler.
Copyright   : Allele Dev 2015
License     : BSD-3
Maintainer  : allele.dev@gmail.com
Stability   : experimental
Portability : POSIX

Composable handler for Exception effects. Communicates success/failure
via an Either type.

Using <http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/Eff1.hs> as a
starting point.
